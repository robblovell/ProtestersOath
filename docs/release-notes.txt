I have fixed the login and update a number of small features:
1. The barcode screen draws as conceived.
2. All print statements have been removed
3. Remove +1 off of phone numbers if it is present.
4. Back buttons and icons have been reworked.
5. Reworked the reason and stories pages.
6. Polished login and oath pages.
7. Improved error messaging in the login flow.
